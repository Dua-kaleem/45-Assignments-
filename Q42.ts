// 42. Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39.
// Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding
// the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to
// see that the list has actually been modified.



//create the make_great function

//create showMagicians function

//call make_great to modify the array
